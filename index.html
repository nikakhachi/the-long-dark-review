        <p class='article' id='p1'>A geomagnetic anomaly has plunged the world into darkness and rendered all technology useless, including the plane you
        were flying over the vast, frozen wilds of Canada. You awake surrounded by flames and wreckage—badly injured and
        freezing to death—and find yourself in a battle to survive in one of the most inhospitable corners of the planet. It’s a
        hell of a place to spend the apocalypse, and death lingers around every corner of this deadly, wintry expanse.
        
        There are two distinct ways to play The Long Dark. There’s Wintermute, an episodic story mode that follows bush pilot
        Will Mackenzie as he searches for his missing friend. This is a linear experience with stylish, melancholy cutscenes
        exploring his past and the state of the world. Then there’s Sandbox, which lets you tell your own stories and explore at
        your leisure. The only objective here is surviving for as long as possible, and how you do that is left to you.</p>

            <h3>SURVIVAL</h3>
            <img src="./img/survival.jpg" alt="survival poster">
            <p id='survival-text'>In survival mode, the player can freely explore and survive inside a sandbox environment. Unlike story mode, the survival
            mode has no quests or plots, and the player may travel between regions without restriction.
            
            Survival mode is a permadeath experience. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game.</p>
